# Improving the Earthquake Nowcasting Code

*Comments by Geoffrey Fox, 15 March 2023*

The Earthquake forecasting code has been improved following the recent
studies of

  Included, Contain Information About Future Large Earthquakes?"  John

These two papers identify that the occurrence rate of medium earthquakes
(m `>` 3.29) represented by smoothing in a time series of their number
reveals the hidden variables controlling large earthquakes with
magnitude `>=` 6.75. In particular, the rate of these medium earthquakes
decreases before a large quake; due to aftershocks, their number peaks
after a large earthquake.

We added this observable with 9 different smoothing methods to the
existing earthquake nowcasting code with the simplest LSTM model. This
gave for the earthquake activity in the next 4 years.

- Normalized Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency NNSE with Original code as in

Which is a significant improvement. We used the Morris method to find
which physics observable was most significant and ran with just this
getting slightly better.
